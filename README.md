# NPDL
## Installation
Install dependencies on a python environment (3.x)
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Execute the following commands:
```
$ cd datasets/
$ ./get_datasets.sh
$ ./get_sentiment_analysis.sh
$ cd ../utils/cython/
$ ./build_cython.sh
```
For the seq2seq dataset, download at the following link (no download script since kaggle asks for authentication):

```
This project was made for academic purposes (Universit√© de Sherbrooke) and aims to help graduate students understand the implementation details of various neural network architectures. The library runs on CPU, and as a result many of the models tested in the notebooks are not meant to reach great levels of performance, especially the more complicated models (e.g. seq2seq Transformers).
```
The code is commented in french (requested by our supervising professor). Some function signatures were modified with "_npdl" to make it harder for students to find this code with a copy-paste. The commit history on this repository is empty, since the projet was originally made on the university's GitLab and copied to GitHub afterwards.
